README

Thank you for taking a look at EW-FAC. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me at hardsnow@vt.edu.

Please do not distribute this work. It has not been published, and as such should be considered a beta product not intended for public use.

I have written a quick use guide that should provide all the basic information needed to use the model. Like the model, if you find any errors or confusion with using the guide, please feel free to email me.
